# Rails Kickoff
Starts off with a bunch of defaults for faster screencast setup.

Tested Rails Version 
`gem 'rails', '~> 6.0.0`

Tested Ruby Versions
`ruby '2.6.3'`

## How it works
When creating a new rails app simply pass the template file through.

#### Creating a new app

```bash
$ rails new myapp -d <postgresql, mysql, sqlite> -m template.rb
```
